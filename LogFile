- For Xcode 4.6
  Patch: http://www.mathworks.com.au/support/solutions/en/data/1-FR6LXJ/
  Download corresponding "optsPatch_MACOSX(x).patch" and follow the instructions

Linux:
Very first Commit:

- Its example can properly execute on a small-size image with precompiled packages. 

- RAM issue will occur, when it is running on a large-size image.

- Some compiling errors occurred, when I tried to build packages with "build.sh".

MAC OS X:
Least Commit
- link "/Applications/MATLAB2011b.app/bin/matlab" to "/usr/bin/matlab" by
	ln -s /Applications/MATLAB2011b.app/bin/matlab /usr/bin/

- export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$<path to gPb>/grouping/lib:/usr/lib

- Run MATLAB using terminal command, otherwise MATLAB will lose the path of dylib library

- Then, examples will run correctly on both small-size and large-size images.
